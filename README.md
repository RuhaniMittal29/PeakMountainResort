# Peak Mountain Resort - Case Competition🏠📈

**Challenge:** Peak Mountain Resort, a top-tier destination for year-round adventurous activities, faced challenges such as seasonal safety issues, aging infrastructure, slow emergency response times, and rising operational costs.

We tackled the challenge through **data-driven analysis** and **NLP models**. By utilizing **DistilBERT for sentiment analysis and BERTopic for topic modeling**, we were able to better understand customer concerns from reviews. Additionally, by analyzing incident and revenue data, we identified critical pain points such as slow response times and operational inefficiencies. Through this we successfully developed actionable recommendations to enhance resort operations, improve safety protocols, and optimize resource allocation.
